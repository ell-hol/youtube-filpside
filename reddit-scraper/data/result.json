        "post_text": "Hello fellow SaaS builders. My name is Jacob & I'm the founder of /r/Rezi. https://www.rezi.ai/\nRezi is the #1 AI resume software known for creating resumes that force the user to follow best practices so they land an interview.\nI started the company approximately 9 years ago, shortly after graduating college.\nI faced the pain-point myself. In college, I had a 2.2 GPA yet still managed to get interviews at companies like Dropbox, Google, EA, Goldman Sachs, & Kaplan.\nI realized that the secret to getting invited to interviews was my resume. Learning how to optimize your resume will give you an edge rather than mindlessly applying for 1000s of positions.\nMy secrets to land more interviews:\nBeating the ATS: Most large companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter resumes before a person even sees them. You have to create a resume tailored to the exact job description.\n\nUse the right keywords: Scan the job description and make sure those exact words and phrases are in your resume.\nKeep formatting simple: ATS can't always read fancy formatting. Stick to clear fonts and basic bullet points.\n\nDetails, Details, Details: Don't just say what you did; explain the what, why, and how of each task or accomplishment.\n\nFor example, instead of writing, \"Managed social media,\" write: \"Developed and executed a social media content calendar that increased engagement by 20% in six months using platform analytics and A/B testing.\"\n\nTailor Every Single Time: Yes, it's a pain, but you need to customize your resume for each job application.\n\nFocus on the job description: Highlight the skills and experiences that are most relevant to that specific role.\nMirror the language: Use the same terminology that is used in the job posting. Chris Voss recommends mirroring the language even in high-stakes negotiations.\n\nFormatting Matters More Than You Think: A clean, easy-to-read resume makes a big difference.\n\nUse simple fonts like Arial or Times New Roman.\nUse consistent bullet points.\nUse clear section headings.\n\nAnd so I made a post on Reddit sharing my resume template. It went viral and many people were asking for the template so I thought why not create a website and sell the template there. That was how Rezi came about.\nOver the next few years, I moved to South Korea to explore the growing tech scene in 2016. I ultimately raised some angel investment, built a basic software prototype of the resume template, launched that for free, and further validated the idea with technology and then ultimately launched Rezi as it is today, and that was five years ago.\nWe recently crossed $5.4 million in lifetime revenue, which you can verify on the Indiepage Leaderboard, where we're ranked #1.\nAsk me anything about resumes, building a SaaS, fundraising, SEO, or anything that comes to your mind.\nI‚Äôm super happy to share resume tips as well to help you land better jobs or even any job if you have been one of the unlucky ones. AI has killed a lot of jobs for juniors (look up Fiverr/Upwork stock) in 2024 & in 2025, it'll kill even more jobs (ahem.. web developers) so I know what its like. If you don't wanna ask publicly, do ask privately in DMs but publicly would be better as others can learn from your question.\nAlrighttt gooo!!!\n\n",

Every few days, I added new features: folder creation, saving prompts for reuse, and much more.\nAfter gathering tons of feedback, I realized I‚Äôd solved a real problem‚Äîone people were willing to pay for.\n1 month ago ago, I launched the paid version! There are now three tiers: Free, Monthly Subscription, and Lifetime Access.\nHere‚Äôs the wild part: just minutes after flipping the switch, someone from the U.S. bought a lifetime subscription. Then, someone from Spain grabbed a monthly plan. And it just kept going!\nEight weeks ago, I had an idea. Today, I have paying customers. The sense of fulfillment is absolutely unreal‚Äîit‚Äôs a feeling that words just can‚Äôt capture. üôå\nI think that what really sets me apart is how much I care about my clients. I always make them my top priority, and I try to respond to emails within minutes whenever possible. Providing fast, thoughtful, and reliable support is super important to me because I want my clients to feel valued and taken care of.\nIf you are a heavy ChatGPT user, please give it a shot, there is absolutely no way you will regret it\nTry it here:\nhttps://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-toolbox/jlalnhjkfiogoeonamcnngdndjbneina\nThis may not exactly be a passive income, but my goal is to get to a larger number of subscribers, and i am working very hard to get there, after that, i hope it will become passive :)\n\n",

I needed something that took 5 seconds to set up, not another Zendesk. Weekend build in Next.js + Supabase, charged $29/mo from day one.\nFirst 60 days: 312 signups, 18 paying. Found customers by answering questions in r/SaaS and indie hacker Discord servers. Cold emailed maybe 50 people who complained about feedback tools on Twitter.\nNumbers at exit\n\nRevenue: $8,200/mo\nExpenses: ~$1,400/mo (hosting $340, Stripe fees $250, VA $800)\nProfit: ~$6,800/mo\nCustomers: 283 paying\nChurn: 3% monthly\nTech: Next.js, Postgres, BullMQ, hosted on Vercel + Railway\n\nWhat worked\n\nKilled features aggressively. Had analytics, team seats, custom branding. Deleted everything except the core widget. Activation rate went from 24% to 61%.\nOne price, no tiers. Moved from $29 to $79/mo. Lost some customers but profit went up.\nPosted revenue publicly. Every month on Twitter. July's post got 400 likes and 3 acquisition inquiries.\n\nWhat didn't\n\nSpent 6 weeks on SSO for an enterprise lead. They ghosted after demo.\nFacebook ads at $3k MRR. Burned $2k, got 4 customers who all churned.\nRewrote my perfectly fine cron jobs in Temporal. Took a weekend, changed nothing for users.\n\nThe exit\n\nBuyer: Solo PE guy who owns 5 other micro-SaaS. Found me through Twitter.\nDue diligence: 2 weeks. Stripe exports, P&L, code walkthrough on Zoom.\nPrice: $285,000 (2.9x annual revenue)\nTerms: 85% at close, 15% after 6 months if churn stays under 5%\nTransition: 12 weeks, 6 hours/week, $150/hr\n\nSold because I was facing the \"hire someone or stay small\" decision. I like building new things more than scaling existing ones.\nKey lessons\n\nKeep a clean P&L from day one. Buyers care more about boring spreadsheets than your tech stack.\nDistribution > product. My competitor had better features but I answered every Reddit question.\nCharge more. Nobody who paid $29 complained when I raised to $79.\n\n\n",

All trying to grow without burning out.\nI wasn‚Äôt trying to find some ‚Äúsecret formula,‚Äù but after 30‚Äì40 convos, a few clear patterns started to repeat.\nHere are 7 that stuck with me:\n1. One ‚Äúhero metric‚Äù at a time\nInstead of tracking 20 things, they zoomed in on one metric (often activation %) and focused on nothing else for 6‚Äì12 weeks.\n2. Retention before growth\nNone of them scaled paid ads until retention was solid. Like, 95%+ NRR solid. Otherwise, you‚Äôre just fueling churn.\n3. Ruthless onboarding simplification\nThe goal? Get users to their first win in under 3 minutes. Most of the time, that meant deleting steps, not adding tooltips.\n4. Founder-led demos still matter\nEven at $80k+ MRR, a bunch of them were still hopping on 5+ demo calls/week. Apparently, ‚Äútalk to the builder‚Äù beats any sales funnel.\n5. Annual billing after product-market fit\nThey didn‚Äôt start with it, but once churn was under control, annual plans helped fund that next hire or experiment.\n6. Start niche, then expand\nThe ones who grew fastest weren‚Äôt trying to serve ‚Äúevery startup.‚Äù They nailed a narrow use case (like ‚ÄúXero accountants in Canada‚Äù) first.\n7. Obsess over every cancellation\nThis one hit hard ‚Äî most of them personally followed up on every cancel with 1‚Äì2 simple questions. Feedback was shipped fast.\nI‚Äôm curious now,  if you‚Äôve grown a SaaS past $5k MRR, what did your turning points look like?\nWhat made a real difference?\nAnd if you're earlier than that which of these do you agree or totally disagree with?\nWould love to hear what‚Äôs resonated (or flopped) in your journey.\n\n",

        "post_text": "TL;DR: Product Hunt has become a graveyard dressed as a celebration.\nThis year I got obsessed with a question: what happens AFTER the Product Hunt glory?\nSo I tracked 500 launches from January-June 2024. 6-8 months later, here's the brutal truth:\nThe Numbers Don't Lie\n\n487/500 (97.4%) make less than $1,000 MRR\n456/500 (91.2%) have <100 active users\n423/500 (84.6%) haven't updated since launch month\nOnly 13 are profitable enough to pay founder salary\n\nYeah, you read that right. 97.4% failure rate.\nThe Pattern I Found in Every Dead Product\nEvery zombie product had the same story:\n\n\"Cool idea\" phase (6 months coding in isolation)\nProduct Hunt launch (1 day of fame + dopamine hit)\n\"Now let's find customers\" phase (reality hits hard)\nSlow death (founders quietly move on)\n\nHere's What the 13 Survivors Did Differently\nThey started with paying customers BEFORE building anything.\nNot beta users. Not email signups. Paying customers.\nExample: One successful product had 47 people paying $50/month BEFORE they wrote a single line of code.\nHow? They posted their problem in 15 Slack communities, asked \"who else has this pain?\" and collected pre-payments.\nResult: $2,350 MRR guaranteed before development started.\nThe Uncomfortable Truth About Product Hunt\nProduct Hunt rewards spectacle, not substance.\n\n1,000 upvotes feels amazing\n10 customers paying $100/month IS amazing\n\nThe real validation isn't hunters clicking a button. It's customers opening their wallets.\nWhat This Means for Your SaaS\nIf you're building something, ask yourself:\n\nHow many people have paid money for your solution to exist?\nNot \"would pay\" - have paid.\nNot \"interested\" - committed cash.\n\nIf the answer is 0, you're building a hobby, not a business.\nThe Data Behind This Post\nI spent the last 3 months tracking these 2024 launches:\nMethodology:\n\nScraped all launches Jan-June 2024 with 100+ upvotes\nTracked website status, pricing pages, social activity over 6-8 months\nContacted founders directly (23% response rate)\nCross-referenced with public revenue data where available\n\nDefinition of \"dead\":\n\nNo product updates in 6+ months\nWebsite down or abandoned\nFounder moved to different project\n<$1K MRR confirmed by founder\n\nThe Most Common Delusions\n\"We just need more features\" - No, you need customers first\n\"We launched too early\" - No, you validated too late\n\"Product Hunt didn't give us enough traffic\" - Traffic ‚â† customers\n\"We need better marketing\" - No, you need product-market fit\nWhat This Makes Me Think\nThis analysis has me questioning everything about how we build products.\nWhat if the entire \"build first, find customers later\" model is fundamentally broken?\nWhat if instead of showcasing finished products, we showcased problems people are willing to pay to solve?\nI keep thinking: there has to be a better way to validate demand before burning months of development time.\nQuestions for r/SaaS\n\nFor successful founders: How many customers did you have BEFORE building?\nFor failed founders: Did you confuse interest with demand?\nFor current builders: How confident are you people will actually pay?\nFor everyone: What's the most money you've wasted building something nobody wanted?\n\nBe honest. The data suggests most of us are lying to ourselves.\nWhat do you think? Am I being too harsh on Product Hunt or is this the reality most founders ignore?\nP.S. - I know some of you will say \"correlation ‚â† causation\" and you're right. But 97.4% failure rate suggests the current model is fundamentally broken.\nP.P.S. - This analysis has me seriously reconsidering how I approach my next project. Anyone else rethinking their strategy?\n\n",

        "post_text": "Hello üëã\nI recently sold my first SaaS (iCodeThis) for $50,000 and wanted to share the entire story with you. Hope you'll enjoy reading it and learn something from my experience! ‚ò∫Ô∏è\nIn this post, I‚Äôm going to share:\n\nHow I went from idea to building the platform\nHow I grew it to 56k members\nHow much money it generated\nThe entire acquisition process\nWhat‚Äôs next for me\n\nHow It Started\nBack in December 2022, I wanted to build a daily coding challenge platform for front-end developers. The goal was to create real-world challenges that would help devs improve their skills by building something, not just watching endless tutorials.\nI validated the idea by sharing posts of UI designs on Twitter and asking people to convert them into code. Once I saw the engagement was growing I knew that the idea was validated so I built a basic app that allowed users to log in and post their code to the site. This way I could get the members coming back to the platform.\nOver time, I added more and more features on top turning it into a full-fledged platform.\nGrowing the Platform\nThe platform started as a free challenge site, but I later introduced different paid tiers for users who wanted premium features like access to past challenges, more complex challenges, and additional resources.\nSome key growth strategies I used:\n\nDaily content ‚Äì New coding challenges every day kept users engaged daily.\nBuilding a Discord community ‚Äì Encouraging users to share their solutions, get feedback, and engage with each other.\nBuilding in public ‚Äì Posted about the process of building the platform on X (Twitter), YouTube, and LinkedIn.\nAffiliate marketing ‚Äì I got some people to promote it by making videos, which helped drive more traffic and sign-ups and in return, I paid them a commission.\n\nEventually, iCodeThis grew to 56,000+ total members, with hundreds of people participating daily.\nTech Stack\nHere‚Äôs what I used to build iCodeThis:\n\nFrontend & Backend: Next.js\nStyling: Tailwind CSS\nDatabase, Auth & Storage: Supabase\nHosting: Vercel\nPayments: Stripe\n\nRevenue\nThe majority of revenue came from one-time payments, totaling $67,000 USD in revenue.\nI also tried subscriptions but they didn‚Äôt scale well (peaked at $300 MRR), so I went back to focusing on one-time payments as the primary monetization strategy.\nUsing a one-time payment model allowed me to capture a higher lifetime value from each customer, and it also made more sense for the type of product I was offering.\nThe Sale - Why I Sold It\nAfter running iCodeThis for two years, I started feeling burned out. I wanted to focus on new projects and felt that someone else could take iCodeThis further than I could. Also, having $50k in cash would give me more flexibility for my next ventures.\nFinding a Buyer\nI didn‚Äôt have a clear plan to sell it initially. But after posting about my thoughts on X (Twitter), Boot.dev reached out with interest last year. We hadn't closed a deal at that time because I wasn't ready to sell yet.\nThis year, I decided to sell it and reached out to Lane (CEO of Boot.dev) again asking if he was still interested. He was and after a bit of negotiation, we agreed on $50k.\nWhy $50k?\nI based the price on a mix of:\n\nRevenue potential ($67k in revenue)\nCommunity & user base (56k+ members)\nBrand & SEO value\nSocial promotion\n\nAfter some back-and-forth, we agreed on $50,000 as a fair price.\nThe Sale Process\nThe first step was signing an agreement with Boot.dev. We drafted a contract that covered all aspects of the sale, including the $50,000 purchase price, payment schedule, and specific terms for asset transfers.\nThe asset transfer involved migrating the domain, transfering the Supabase database, GitHub repository, Discord community, etc.\nThe handover was very fast. It took us about 2-3 hours to transfer all the assets, which for me was a relief because I was thinking that it would take days or even weeks.\nI got $10k after signing the agreement and the rest of the payment hit my bank account after I sent the assets.\nThe sale went smoothly, and just like that‚Ä¶ iCodeThis was no longer mine!\nWhat‚Äôs Next for Me?\nSelling iCodeThis gave me a fresh start. Now, I‚Äôm focused on:\n\nTrying new ventures until I find my next big idea\nGrowing Indie Action (new SaaS) into a sustainable business\nSharing my journey to making $1,000,000 through my blog & YouTube channel\n\nRight now I‚Äôm working on Indie Action - a gamified time-tracking app to help builders stay focused and get things done in a fun way.\nI built it to help me stay focused on my own projects and it's been a great tool so far and people seem to like it too, which is great.\nAm I Sad About Selling iCodeThis?\nMaybe a little bit as it was my first real project that gained significant traction. But at the same time, I feel relieved. I feel like it served its purpose for me, and now it has a new home where it can keep growing.\nFinal Thoughts\nSelling iCodeThis was a huge milestone for me. It wasn‚Äôt a life-changing amount of money, but it proved that I could build and sell a profitable SaaS. Now, I‚Äôm taking those lessons and applying them to my next ventures.\nIf you‚Äôre building your own SaaS, my advice:\n\nFocus on growth ‚Äì A strong user base increases valuation.\nBe open to opportunities ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt plan to sell initially, but the right offer came along at the right time and I took it.\nKeep building ‚Äì Every project is a stepping stone to the next big thing.\n\nI‚Äôm excited for what‚Äôs next! üöÄ\nLet me know if you have any questions and I'll answer gladly! üòÑ\n\n",
